## Setup
During development we have the server running on localhost port 8000, but before running locally, be sure to run:

- 'npm install' to install our dependencies
- 'npm install gulp -g' to make sure gulp is installed
- 'gulp start' to build the dist/ folder, start the server with nodemon, and to watch files for changes

We used a dotenv npm package to configure our development variables. Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables and their values:
- DATABASE_URL
- JWT_SECRET
- MAILGUN_API_KEY
- MAILGUN_DOMAIN
