# EvenHire ![](https://travis-ci.org/tdax/evenHire.svg?branch=master)

EvenHire is a responsive web application that removes the unconscious bias from the hiring process by hiding data that might reveal gender or ethnicity, allowing recruiters to diversify their workforce. EvenHire was concieved and by a team of four full-stack software engineers: [Alice Kao](https://github.com/alicekao), [Darko Gjorgoski](https://github.com/darko7), [Thomas Sorensen](https://github.com/tps-80), and [Xavier Hayeck](https://github.com/xhayeck)

## Setup
During development we have the server running on localhost port 8000, but before running locally, be sure to run:
- `npm install` to install our dependencies
- `npm install gulp -g` to make sure gulp is installed
- `gulp start` to build the dist/ folder, start the server with nodemon, and to watch files for changes

We used the [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) npm package to configure our development variables. Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables and their values:
- DATABASE_URL
- DEV_DATABASE_URL
- JWT_SECRET
- MAILGUN_API_KEY
- MAILGUN_DOMAIN

## Style Guide
Please refer to the [STYLE-GUIDE.md](docs/STYLE-GUIDE.md) file to see our style guide.

## Testing
For client-side testing we used mocha and chai, and for server-side testing we used mocha and chai along with [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest). To run all tests run:
```
gulp tests
```
For server-side tests only, run:
```
gulp serverTest
```
For client-side tests only, run:
```
gulp clientTest
```
## Styling
All of our files and images used for styling are located in the `client/assets/` directory. If gulp is not already running, run gulp to copy images and compile scss into the `dist/` folder.
